To the contrary, leaving alone many aspects of the language, I try to give thorough understanding of logical structure of data and, as a result, to give the idea of correct form of query taking into account structure. On top of that, we strongly believe, that reading of this book will contribute to understanding of the problems, which are outside the scope of this work."
